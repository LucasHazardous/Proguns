# Proguns

> Minecraft mod that introduces three unique guns with various abilities, one jumping entity and command.

## Requirements

Fabric API in mods directory and Fabric loader.

## Features

All guns are used with right-click and can be crafted with normal Minecraft items and have different durability. They access ammo from the ethereal intergalactic storage so no ammo in the inventory is required.

- Pro Sniper Gun - gun that has scope. **Warning!** If you are using sniper gun and quickly switch to other slot without releasing right-click your eye will be stuck in the scope!
- Pro Smg Gun - very fast and inaccurate gun.
- Pro Gun - normal gun.
- Pro Entity - small aqua ball that quickly jumps around. Can be spawned with Pro Entity Spawn Egg.
- /bonk - command that gives each gun and 64 Pro Entity's spawn eggs.
- Explosive Item - ammunition for all pro guns. Can be thrown with hand.
